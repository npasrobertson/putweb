    <p>There are 5 stages of a product life cycle, these are important as it  offers guidance for developing strategies to make the best use of those stages and promote the overall success of the product in the market place .</p>
    <p><img src="assets/lifecycle.png" alt="lifecycle"></p>
    <p>In case I need to link/hyperlink a website <a href="https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/creamy-cheese-rice/">Cheese and Rice</a></p>
    <h3>Stage 1- Development </h3>
<p> This stage is the stage where the product is being researched before being introduced into the market. This stage sets out how the others should be.</p>
<h3>Stage 2- Introduction </h3>
<p> This can also be considered the first stage as in this stage the product is being idroduced into the market</p>
<p> This stage marketing and promotion are at high. The principal goals of the indroduct stage are to build demand fro the product and get it into the hands of consumers, hoping later cash in on its growth</p>
<h3>Stage 3- Growth</h3>

<p>This stage the product will start do bring money in and is where most sales will happen. Demand and profit will increase and competition will start to notice you and try to impede your success. This stage your brand will start to establish a prescence and a place in the market. Now you need show why customers should choose you over anyone else in the market. As the company grows you can start to experiment and add new features, relase more products and create ways to make better customer support and new distribution channels to allow for more products to sell and make things cheaper to do. This will make your company engrained into the market.</p>
<h3>Stage 4- Maturity</h3>
<p>When things start to settle in after rapid growth, the company needs to stay competitive to stay in the market and carry on competing, this can be done by doing things such as reducing prices. Marketing must now focus on helping sell more products instead of trying to keep gaining focus on the company as the presence is already established. In all production and distribution costs decline and sales set steady. However to keep customers returning you have to invest the money into keeping customers returning and making sure they know your the superior brand and that you will keep improving to take over the market.  </p>
